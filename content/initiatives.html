                  The OH-SCIPE project’s aim is to increase the number of Cyberinfrastructure Professionals (CIP), that is people who support the computing needs of researchers at universities, who have experience with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. As part of this project, we have an annual summer internship program; this is the first year. If you are interested in applying to the OH_SCIPE 2024 summer internship program see link to
                  <a href="#">apply below</a>. We’ll match you up with a research team at Case Western Reserve University, The Ohio State University, or University of Cincinnati and provide training and guidance on the AI and HPC technologies needed for your project.

                <p>
                  Faculty and research computing staff at Case Western Reserve University, Ohio Supercomputer Center, and University of Cincinnati were awarded funding from the National Science Foundation’s NSF's Strengthening the Cyberinfrastructure Professionals Ecosystem (SCIPE) program for the project “Interdisciplinary Research Support Community for Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences'', NSF Awards OAC-2320952, 2320953, 2320954. We refer to this project as OH-SCIPE.

                  Research in every field of Science and Engineering can be accelerated by leveraging modern advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML). Unfortunately, there is a lack of experts to help researchers understand and integrate the latest ML capabilities into their work. This project aims to address this critical need by creating and sustaining a cohort of cyberinfrastructure (CI) professionals (CIP) with the experience and training to empower researchers to effectively leverage ML techniques. To address the immediate research needs we are in the process of hiring 4 ML Engineers and facilitators at CWRU (2), OSC(1), and UC(1) with AI expertise as project team members. In addition to adding these CI staff positions, the project aims to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration and foster innovation while developing career pathways for future interdisciplinary CI professionals (maybe you?).

                  Furthermore, by engaging with a range of universities and colleges including R2, minority-serving institutions, and two-year colleges, the project aims to grow the pool of talent for the CIP workforce by providing opportunities to students, faculty, and staff at partner institutions around the state. As part of this engagement, we are establishing a summer internship program with the first cohort (3 interns) to start in start in May of 2024. We are working with several research teams to identify our summer projects and will post summaries here when available. Please check back.
