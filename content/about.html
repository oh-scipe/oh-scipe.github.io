                  The project team is inherently interdisciplinary, cutting
                  across CI, HPC, AI/ML, Datascience, Materials Data Science,
                  Healthcare and Biomedical Imaging, and Engineering. The PIs
                  represent a unique synergistic team with expertise in the
                  requisite areas to successfully deliver this project. The team
                  is diverse, and two of the three site PIs are women (Karen
                  Tomko and Jane Combs).
