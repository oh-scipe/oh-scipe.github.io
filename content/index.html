                    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)
                    technologies have significantly accelerated research across
                    all fields of Science and Engineering (S&E). Leveraging these
                    advancements, our project aims to further integrate
                    cutting-edge machine learning engineering into S&E research
                    initiatives.

                  <p>
                    Historically, Computational Infrastructure (CI) support for
                    S&E research has been foundational, beginning with the
                    establishment of the Coalition for Academic Scientific
                    Computation (CASC) in 1989. Building on this legacy, OH-SCIPE
                    is dedicated to enhancing S&E research by facilitating the
                    incorporation of ML Engineers into research teams.
