                  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)
                  technologies have significantly accelerated research across
                  all fields of Science and Engineering (S&E). Leveraging these
                  advancements, our project aims to further integrate
                  cutting-edge machine learning engineering into S&E research
                  initiatives.

                <p>
                  Historically, Computational Infrastructure (CI) support for
                  S&E research has been foundational, beginning with the
                  establishment of the Coalition for Academic Scientific
                  Computation (CASC) in 1989. Building on this legacy, OH-SCIPE
                  is dedicated to enhancing S&E research by facilitating the
                  incorporation of ML Engineers into research teams.
